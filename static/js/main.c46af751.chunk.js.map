Shields, and this website is my first step towards chasing my dream career. I have always been a person who is committed to his job; I worked in a restaurant \r\n                for four years, then I worked a sales floor for three years, and I also worked as a care provider in mental health services for the last ten years. In all my years working I am grateful \r\n                for all the opportunities I had to help others and make an impact on their lives. Now I have a new career in sight, and I'm hoping that is why you're here! Pursuing full-stack development \r\n                is my gamble on myself, in an attempt to achieve a career that I truly enjoy learning and implementing. Coding can be infuriating and difficult, as I'm sure you're aware. However, the \r\n                feeling you get when you solve a difficult problem, or you finally get your project live after all your hard work is second to none. Which, I believe, is what makes me an excellent part \r\n                of your team. Throughout my training I've gone through all the highs and lows you might expect while trying to completely change career paths and learn something as difficult as full-stack \r\n                development. But, for each road-block I've faced I continued working and learning, because I am motivated and driven to make this career my own. If you're interested in learning more about my \r\n                work history please click the link for my resume or linkedin profile\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                But, I'm not all 0's and 1's! I'm currently living in the Michigan area and I've been here most of my life. I was born in a small town, Midland, MI and spent most of my life there. I graduated \r\n                in 2009 from Midland High, and pursued my college degree at Delta Community College until I transferred to Michigan State University. My degree took a while to finish, but I never gave up on \r\n                finishing it. I am a huge hockey fan (Let's Go Red Wings!), and even play in a fall adult league myself. My interest in computers started from an interest in gaming, which I still enjoy today. \r\n                From there it just evolved from building PCs, to basic troubleshooting, and now to advanced concepts as well as development. I do love to travel and have been all over the U.S, Canada, and even China.\r\n                 So my sense of adventure is strong and I would be willing to relocate to the right place.
